      <h2>
        Svākkhāto Bhagavatā dhammo, Sandiṭṭhiko, Akāliko, Ehipassiko,
        Opaneyyiko, Paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūhi
      </h2>

      <h3>Svākkhāto dhammo</h3>
      <p>
        The Dharma consists of ten correct dharmas that the Buddha preached
        perfectly, with a beginning, middle, and end, with full and clear
        meaning
      </p>

      <h3>Sandiṭṭhiko</h3>
      <p>
        The Dharma includes 9 Dharmas that go past the three realms that the
        Arahants have attained the 4 Paths - 4 Holy Results and Nibbana, then
        see and know for themselves with their own wisdom.
      </p>

      <h3>Akāliko</h3>
      <p>
        The Dhamma is the Four Holy Paths that give corresponding results. The
        Four Holy Paths have no time interval, meaning that after attaining a
        Path, that Result immediately gives rise to that Result after a moment
        of mind destruction and then birth.
      </p>

      <h3>Ehipassiko</h3>
      <p>
        The true Dharma are the nine Dharmas that transcend the three realms and
        belong to the True Dharma, which is very pure and clean, so everyone is
        dared you to witness, to truly realize, to truly attain.
      </p>

      <h3>Opaneyyiko</h3>
      <p>
        The true Dharma is the nine Dharmas that transcend the three realms.
        This is the Dharma that one should first direct the mind to attain in
        order to hope to be liberated from the suffering of birth, death, and
        reincarnation in the three realms and four lower species.
      </p>

      <h3>Paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūhi</h3>
      <p>
        That Dharma is the nine Dharmas that transcend the three realms that the
        wise and holy ones have attained, know for themselves, and enter the
        Holy Result of enjoying the peaceful and tranquil Nirvana.

      <h2>Ten unwholesome Actions</h2>
      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <p>Read this excerpt and try to figure out what the ten unwholesome actions are.</p>
      <br /><br />
      <ol>
        <li>
          Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
          the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, and eventually he
          arrived at a Kosalan brahman village called Sala.
        </li>
        <li>
          The brahman householders of Sala heard: "A monk called Gotama, it
          seems, a son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has
          been wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus
          and has come to Sala. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been
          spread to this effect: 'That Blessed One is such since he is arahant
          and Fully Enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime,
          knower of worlds, incomparable teacher of men to be tamed, teacher of
          gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He describes this world with
          its gods, its Maras, and its (Brahma) Divinities, this generation with
          its monks and brahmans, with its kings and its people, which he has
          himself realized through direct knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma that is
          good in the beginning, good in the middle and good in the end with
          (the right) meaning and phrasing, he affirms a holy life that is
          utterly perfect and pure.' Now it is good to see such arahants."
        </li>
        <li>
          The brahman householders of Sala went to the Blessed One; and some
          paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some
          exchanged greetings with him, and when the courteous and amiable talk
          was finished, sat down at one side; some raised hands palms together
          in salutation to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some
          pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One's presence and sat
          down at one side; some kept silence and sat down at one side.
        </li>
        <li>
          When they were seated, they said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama,
          what is the reason, what is the condition, why some beings here, on
          the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in states of
          deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell;
          and what is the reason, what is the condition, why some beings here,
          on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a happy
          destination, even in the heavenly world?"
        </li>
        <li>
          "Householders, it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with the
          Dhamma, by reason of unrighteous conduct, that beings here on the
          dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in states of
          deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. It
          is by reason of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, by reason of
          righteous conduct, that some beings here on the dissolution of the
          body, after death, reappear in a happy destination, even in the
          heavenly world."
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            "We do not understand the detailed meaning of this utterance of
            Master Gotama's spoken in brief without expounding the detailed
            meaning. It would be good if Master Gotama taught us the Dhamma so
            that we might understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's
            utterance spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning."
          </p>
          <p>"Then, householders, listen and heed well what I shall say."</p>
          <p>"Yes, venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          "Householders, there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in
          accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct. There are four kinds
          of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous
          conduct. There are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance
          with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct.
        </li>
        <li>
          "And how are there three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance
          with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone is a killer of
          living beings: he is murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows and
          violence, and merciless to all living beings. He is a taker of what is
          not given: he takes as a thief another's chattels and property in the
          village or in the forest. He is given over to misconduct in sexual
          desires: he has intercourse with such (women) as are protected by the
          mother, father, (mother and father), brother, sister, relatives, as
          have a husband, as entail a penalty, and also with those that are
          garlanded in token of betrothal. That is how there are three kinds of
          bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct.
        </li>
        <li>
          "And how are there four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with
          the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone speaks falsehood: when
          summoned to a court or to a meeting, or to his relatives' presence, or
          to his guild, or to the royal family's presence, and questioned as a
          witness thus, 'So, good man, tell what you know,' then, not knowing,
          he says 'I know,' or knowing, he says 'I do not know,' not seeing, he
          says 'I see,' or seeing, he says 'I do not see'; in full awareness he
          speaks falsehood for his own ends or for another's ends or for some
          trifling worldly end. He speaks maliciously: he is a repeater
          elsewhere of what is heard here for the purpose of causing division
          from these, or he is a repeater to these of what is heard elsewhere
          for the purpose of causing division from those, and he is thus a
          divider of the united, a creator of divisions, who enjoys discord,
          rejoices in discord, delights in discord, he is a speaker of words
          that create discord. He speaks harshly: he utters such words as are
          rough, hard, hurtful to others, censorious of others, bordering on
          anger and unconducive to concentration. He is a gossip: as one who
          tells that which is unseasonable, that which is not fact, that which
          is not good, that which is not the Dhamma, that which is not the
          Discipline, and he speaks out of season speech not worth recording,
          which is unreasoned, indefinite, and unconnected with good. That is
          how there are four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the
          Dhamma, unrighteous conduct.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            "And how are there three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance
            with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone is covetous: he
            is a coveter of another's chattels and property thus: 'Oh, that what
            is another's were mine!' Or he has a mind of ill-will, with the
            intention of a mind affected by hate thus: 'May these beings be
            slain and slaughtered, may they be cut off, perish, or be
            annihilated!' Or he has wrong view, distorted vision, thus: 'There
            is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed, no fruit and
            ripening of good and bad kammas, no this world, no other world, no
            mother, no father, no spontaneously (born) beings,[1] no good and
            virtuous monks and brahmans that have themselves realized by direct
            knowledge and declare this world and the other world.'[2] That is
            how there are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with
            the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct.
          </p>
          <p>
            "So, householders, it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with
            the Dhamma, by reason of unrighteous conduct, that some beings here,
            on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in states of
            deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell.
          </p>
