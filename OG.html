      <h2>
        Svākkhāto Bhagavatā dhammo, Sandiṭṭhiko, Akāliko, Ehipassiko,
        Opaneyyiko, Paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūhi
      </h2>

      <h3>Svākkhāto dhammo</h3>
      <p>
        The Dharma consists of ten correct dharmas that the Buddha preached
        perfectly, with a beginning, middle, and end, with full and clear
        meaning
      </p>

      <h3>Sandiṭṭhiko</h3>
      <p>
        The Dharma includes 9 Dharmas that go past the three realms that the
        Arahants have attained the 4 Paths - 4 Holy Results and Nibbana, then
        see and know for themselves with their own wisdom.
      </p>

      <h3>Akāliko</h3>
      <p>
        The Dhamma is the Four Holy Paths that give corresponding results. The
        Four Holy Paths have no time interval, meaning that after attaining a
        Path, that Result immediately gives rise to that Result after a moment
        of mind destruction and then birth.
      </p>

      <h3>Ehipassiko</h3>
      <p>
        The true Dharma are the nine Dharmas that transcend the three realms and
        belong to the True Dharma, which is very pure and clean, so everyone is
        dared you to witness, to truly realize, to truly attain.
      </p>

      <h3>Opaneyyiko</h3>
      <p>
        The true Dharma is the nine Dharmas that transcend the three realms.
        This is the Dharma that one should first direct the mind to attain in
        order to hope to be liberated from the suffering of birth, death, and
        reincarnation in the three realms and four lower species.
      </p>

      <h3>Paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūhi</h3>
      <p>
        That Dharma is the nine Dharmas that transcend the three realms that the
        wise and holy ones have attained, know for themselves, and enter the
        Holy Result of enjoying the peaceful and tranquil Nirvana.
